# Use Cases

Use on-chain commitments and built-in querying to make any time-series or event data verifiable and easy to access. Here are some ideas:

<table><thead><tr><th width="203.348876953125">Use Case</th><th>What the Integrated Module Does</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>IoT Telemetry</strong></td><td>Each dataset is anchored on-chain as a secure record and indexed for retrieval by device and time.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Supply-Chain Events</strong></td><td>Every shipment step (picked up, in transit, delivered) is recorded under a shipment ID, enabling full history replay.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Proof-of-Location</strong></td><td>Compact GPS pings are saved on-chain for transparency and indexed by device and timestamp for quick lookups.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Document Timestamping</strong></td><td>Document hash batches are anchored on-chain to prove existence and indexed so each proof can be exported or verified.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Access Logs &#x26; Audits</strong></td><td>Critical log entries are written on Solana for an immutable trail and indexed by user, action, and time for audits.</td></tr></tbody></table>
