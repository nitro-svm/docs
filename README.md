# Introduction

### **Why Traditional Simulations Fail on Solana**

Backtests can be misleading. Most systems rely on mathematical models that assume fixed latency, frictionless fills, and predictable execution. But Solana doesn’t behave that way. Real outcomes depend on slot timing, account locking, compute limits, and network congestion: variables that are difficult to capture with math alone.

The gap between simulation and execution creates false confidence during strategy validation:

* Math models don’t reflect the nuanced reality of onchain protocols
* Transaction cost and market impact are underestimated, especially for large or high-frequency trades
* Iteration cycles are slow and paper trading takes days or weeks to reveal flaws
* Constant retuning is required to accommodate the volatility of crypto and DeFi

As a result, strategies that look profitable in backtests often underperform once deployed on mainnet.
