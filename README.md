# Introduction

Termina is a **Network Extension (NE) platform** that integrates Solana applications with **NE** [**modules**](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] for scalability, enhanced privacy, and specialized processing—without a separate chain or fragmented state.

The design goal of the platform is to enable performance and customization while preserving liquidity and ensuring a seamless user experience. It's a new way to scale your app within Solana.
