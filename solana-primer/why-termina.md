# Why Termina

These solutions, while proven and functional, still challenge Solana’s core principle of a **globally unified state machine** by fragmenting liquidity, composability, and user experience. To address this, **Termina** offers a flexible platform for deploying **Solana-native and modular Network Extensions (NEs)** while also supporting traditional scaling approaches like rollups when needed.

Termina extends Solana’s mainnet without requiring developers to build separate execution layers or appchains. For instance, NEs provide:

* **Isolated pools** for custom computation and performance.
* Enhanced **privacy** for sensitive transactions.
* Optimized **performance** without sacrificing Solana’s liquidity or security.

Developers can deploy Anchor contracts to Termina’s environment with zero code changes and leverage the same tooling they use for Solana. The NE stack enables teams to create a custom ecosystem while staying fully integrated with the L1.

This native-first approach aligns with Solana’s vision, offering flexibility, scalability, and modularity while preserving the benefits of a unified and composable blockchain network.
