# Overview

Nitro Labs has built and open-sourced a set of Solana extensions for the broader community. These tools allow developers to extend Solana applications with modular execution, privacy, or data-focused components, without deploying a separate chain or managing fragmented state.

They are provided as OSS building blocks for teams that want deeper control over how their applications execute on Solana:

* **Private or permissioned computation** – Run isolated workloads without modifying Solana’s state.
* **Data-intensive networks** – Store, compress, and retrieve large volumes of off-chain data efficiently.
